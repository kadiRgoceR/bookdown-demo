Rmarkdown: Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. Git: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system https://git-scm.com. R: R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS https://www.r-project.org. Rstudio: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio. Github: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service https://github.com.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19)    Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!   Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable(   head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;,   booktabs = TRUE )  Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2016) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). ddd aaa   "],
